# Asteroids
Recreation of the classic Asteroids game.

This is a short recreation of the Asteroids game I developed in order to familirise myself with game development in JavaFX. This game is a very simple recreation but is a nice starting point for others to add and customise more features.

## Gameplay Directions
* UP arrow - move forward
* LEFT arrow - rotate left
* RIGHT arrow - rotate right
* SPACE - shoot laser
